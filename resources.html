Brown. “Mental Illness Stigma and Ethnocultural Beliefs, Values, and Norms: An Integrative Review.” in <em>Clinical Psychology Review</em>. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 2011. <br><br>https://pages.uncc.edu/richard-mcanulty/wp-content/uploads/sites/268/2018/08/Mental-illness-stigma-and-ethnocultural-beliefs-values-and-norms-An-integrated-review.pdf<br><br>The research provided by authors Abdullah and Brown argues that no culture or race stigmatizes mental illnesses more than another race or culture. The authors prove their argument by studying research conducted by other scholars as well as studying cultural normalities and stigmas created by people. The information provided here is important because it discusses the effects of mental illness stigmas by beliefs or values. This research can be used to prove our research that stigmas and outside factors regarding mental illness can play a role in happiness scores.<br><br>Brereton, Finbarr, J. Peter Clinch, and Susana Ferreira. “Happiness, Geography and the Environment.” in <em>Ecological Economics</em>. Dublin: University College Dublin, 2007. <br><br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223236887_Happiness_Geography_and_the_Environment<br><br>	The research given in this source discusses how geography and the environment have a direct impact on a person’s well-being. These authors use various countries’ environmental data sets as well as research done by other scholars and corporations. The information provided here is important because it gives an explanation of the factor of geography’s connection to a person’s happiness. This will help us answer our research question to prove happiness is a national matter. This could prove that the difference in happiness in countries is due to factors like geography and the environment rather than the individual’s happiness.  <br><br>Byun, Soo-yong and Kyung-keun Kim. “Educational inequality in South Korea: The widening socioeconomic gap in student achievement.” in <em>Research in the Sociology of Education</em>. Centre County: Pennsylvania State University,  Seoul: Korea University, 2010. <br><br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235268313_Educational_inequality_in_South_Korea_The_widening_socioeconomic_gap_in_student_achievement<br><br>Authors Byun and Kim discuss how economic inequality plays a role in a student’s academic achievements. They support their research by referring to the international TIMSS database as well as studies conducted by other scholars. This data is important as it examines how being less fortunate can affect one’s successes. This in turn becomes an important factor that we can use as we determine how outside factors can affect one’s successes which ultimately can be connected to a person’s happiness. <br><br>Delle Fave, Antonella, Ingrid Brdar, Marié P. Wissing, Ulisses Araujo, Alejandro Castro Solano, Teresa Freire, María Del Rocío Hernández-Pozo, et al. “Lay Definitions of Happiness across Nations: The Primacy of Inner Harmony and Relational Connectedness.” in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>. 2016. <br><br>	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4726797/<br><br>In this research, they argue that happiness is a common term that has many definitions because each person defines happiness differently. The authors composed their research by administering the Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation on participants and also chose to refer to studies conducted by other scholars. This source is important because it focuses on how happiness is defined. As the research says, happiness is defined psychologically, and we can connect this research with our study on happiness and the factors that play a role in determining a country’s happiness.<br><br>Easterlin, Richard A. “Happiness and Economic Growth: The Evidence.” in <em>IZA</em>. Los Angeles: University of Southern California and IZA, 2013. <br><br>	http://ftp.iza.org/dp7187.pdf<br><br>	Richard Easterlin argues that happiness does not increase with economic growth. Easterlin frequently uses data from various years of the Gallup World Poll data and refers to other studies and articles written by other scholars. The source itself is valuable because it further analyzes the relationship between happiness and economic growth. Easterlin’s research helps us support our thesis by explaining why countries experiencing economic growth—especially the nordic and tiger Asian countries—have lower happiness scores. <br><br>Gilmour, Robin and Luo Lu. “Cultural Values and Happiness: An East-West Dialogue.” in <em>The Journal of Social Psychology</em>. Taiwan: National Taiwan University, Lancaster: Lancaster University, 2001.<br><br>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11770385_Cultural_Values_and_Happiness_An_East-West_Dialogue<br><br>In this article, Robin Gilmour and Lu Luo conducted a study that looked at the relationships between cultural values and happiness experiences. They referred to studies and articles done by others as well as used the Chinese Happiness Inventory and CVS to measure dimensions of value and happiness. The source itself is important as we are able to look at cultural values and its effect on happiness in Eastern/Western Asian countries. This will act as a great source for the second part of our first research question, in which we will discuss the difference in cultural values between the East and the West.<br><br>Hintikka, Jukka, Pirjo I Saarinen, and Heimo Viinamaeki. “Suicide mortality in Finland during <br>an economic cycle, 1985 - 1995.” in <em>Scand J Public Health</em>. Kuopio: Department of <br>Psychiatry, Kuopio University Hospital, 1999.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kTnrcCpkcR9vAD8YwljP9BXRO_LGX7Cm/view?usp=sharing<br><br>	The article’s research is based on the idea that suicide mortality relate to unemployment, <br>divorce rate, and alcohol consumption and the authors study this idea within the economic cycle of 1985 to 1995. The authors heavily refer to Finland’s statistics on GDP, population, suicide mortality rates, etc… and use studies conducted by other scholars to support their claims on this relationship. The research itself is important as it looks into the well being of a person based on their relationship to their economic situation. We can include this research to support our claims as we prove that the economy has a direct impact on the happiness of a person. <br><br>Lakimova, Olga. “Exploring the Dynamics of Xenophobia in the Nordic Countries.” in <em>Changing Societies &amp; Personalities</em>. Yekaterinburg: Ural Federal University, 2018.<br><br>http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/58790/1/csp_2018_v2_1_03.pdf<br>	<br>In Nordic countries, xenophobic parties and far right-wing extremist groups have risen in the past decade despite them frequently being cited as embracing diversity and offered great protection for racial minorities. This source is supported by researches that connect GDP over the years with tolerance for ethnic immigrants in the Nordic countries. Since our first research question discusses the correlation between GDP, social support, and happiness scores, this source will be very insightful.<br><br>Krys, Kuba. “Family well-being is valued more than personal well-being: A four-country Study.” in <em>Current Psychology</em>. New York City: Springer, 2019.<br><br>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-019-00249-2<br><br>	This article delves into research that shows how generally, regardless of cultural context, overall family well-being is valued more than personal well-being. This could be used in support of our second question which discusses how happiness became a national matter over an individual manner. This article also discusses the difference between WEIRD countries and other countries in terms of values of happiness and collectivism, which will be helpful in answering our first question.<br><br>Laurent, Éloi. "Happiness." in <em>Measuring Tomorrow: Accounting for Well-Being, Resilience, and Sustainability in the Twenty-First Century</em>, 76-87. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2018. <br>	<br>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctvc7727v.14<br><br>This chapter argues that rich people are happier than poor people but people don’t get happier as they get richer. The author uses empirical data from OECD and the World Happiness Report as evidence. This abstract is important because it highlights the spurious correlation between wealth and happiness. It supports our thesis on the positive correlation between social support and happiness. Additionally, it helps explain the happiness score difference between the Nordic countries and the Asian tiger countries.<br><br>Lee, Min-Ah and Ichiro Kawachi. “The keys to happiness: Associations between personal values regarding core life domains and happiness in South Korea.” in <em>Plos One</em>. South Korea: Sogang University, 2019.<br><br>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209821<br><br>	The research here argues that certain aspects of happiness are connected to personal values and beliefs in either positive or negative ways. The authors use a data set about the relationship between personal values and happiness in South Korea, and they also refer to research and scholarly articles done by other researchers. The article itself is valuable because it discusses how happiness connects to personal values. Using this research helps us prove why a country’s low happiness score is due to individuals’ beliefs. We can use this article to argue that happiness especially when happiness is high is a national matter. <br><br>Lu, Luo, Robin Gilmour, and Shu-Fang Kao. 2001. “Cultural Values and Happiness: An East-West Dialogue.” in<em>&nbsp;The Journal of Social Psychology 141</em> (4): 477–93. <br><br>https://doi.org/10.1080/00224540109600566.<br><br>In this paper, the relationships between cultural values and experiences of happiness are being examined.  The authors referred to studies done by other researchers as well as included their own research where they had hundreds of people participate in a study to look at relationships between values and happiness. This article is valuable to draw distinctions between the difference in Eastern and Western cultural values for our first question.<br><br>Malkki, Leena, Mats Fridlund, and Daniel Sallamaa. “Terrorism and Political Violence in the Nordic Countries.” in <em>Terrorism and Political Violence</em>. Helsinki: University of Helsinki, 2018.<br><br>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2018.1447184<br><br>	Authors Malkki, Fridlund, and Sallamaa argue that certain acts of violence and terrorism in Nordic countries have been looked over and research into acts of terrorism and violence would be a huge contribution to research on these countries. The authors cite and refer to studies and articles written by others to support their argument. The research in the article is significant because it explains how the history of the Nordic countries affects policies today. This research is important to us because it gives information on why the Nordic countries are affected by their past history of violence and terrorism, which gives more depth behind their happiness scores that are unaccounted for in the World Happiness Report. <br><br>Meshvara, Deva. 2002. “Mental Health and Mental Health Care in Asia.” in <em>World Psychiatry : Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association.&nbsp;</em>(WPA) 1 (2): 118–20. <br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489866/#:~:text=Mental%20health%20and%20mental%20health%20care%20have%20not%20become%20a,basic%20primary%20care%20mental%20health.<br><br>Author Meshvara argues that mental health care is not something that is “extremely varied” or “standardized,” but should be because mental health is something worth looking at. The author cites studies conducted by other researchers as well as the World Health Report to support her argument. The source is important in the sense that we are able to look at mental health and its importance and connect it with other sources that we’ve researched to prove its effects on happiness. The article will help prove our thesis that mental health plays a role in varying happiness scores.<br><br>Ng, Chee Hong. 1997. “The Stigma of Mental Illness in Asian Cultures.” in <em>Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry.</em> 31 (3): 382–90. <br><br>https://doi.org/10.3109/00048679709073848.<br><br>Author Chee Hong Ng explores the stigma behind mental illness in multiple Asian countries through analyzing historical, cultural, and societal factors. Mr. Ng refers to many studies conducted by others and uses literature relevant to his research. The article itself is important in the sense that we are able to analyze mental illness in Asian countries and how it can affect factors such as happiness. This article will be helpful in the analysis of the second part of our first question, which will touch upon the cultural differences between the East and West. <br><br>Ng, Yew-Kwang. “The East-Asian Happiness Gap: Speculating on Causes and Implications.” in <em>Pacific Economic Review</em>. Hong Kong: City University of Hong Kong, 2002.<br><br>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.876.4820&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf<br><br>	Yew-Kwang Ng argues that factors such as wealth disparities, competitive attitudes, and cultural influences play a role in the happiness gap between Asian Countries. He cites other scholarly articles and journals written by other researchers and cites his own previous research on happiness. The abstract is important because it discusses various factors that affect happiness scores within Asian countries. This correlates with our argument because it connects to why happiness is lower due to outside factors like the feeling of competition or obsession of one’s status.<br><br>Oishi, Shigehiro, Minkyung Koo, &amp; Sharon Akimoto. “Culture, Interpersonal Perceptions, and Happiness in Social Interactions.” in <em>Pers Soc Psychol Bull</em>. Virginia: University of Virginia, Northfield: Carleton College, 2008.<br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396581/<br><br>	This source argues how cultural influences and personal perceptions have an affect on happiness. The authors conducted their own studies with participants and referred to other research done by other scholars. The source is important because it discusses the effects of one’s culture and beliefs on individual happiness and well-being. This can be used to prove that happiness is a national matter because the worry about outside perception has an affect on the greater culture of a country rather than just on the individual.<br><br>Ortiz-Ospina, Esteban. "Happiness and Life Satisfaction." in  <em>Our World In Data</em>. 2013. 	<br><br>https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction<br><br>	Author Ortiz-Ospina discusses the relationship between the idea of happiness with life satisfaction. He refers to the World Happiness Report, the Gallup World Poll, the World Value Survey, as well as studies done by others to help support his research. This article helps give insight on factors like a person’s achievements and relates them to happiness. The research done here will be used to help prove how factors like one’s feelings on their life will impact their happiness. <br><br>Paldam, Martin. “Economic freedom and the success of the Asian tigers: An essay on <br>controversy.” in <em>European Journal of Political Economy</em>. Aarhus: Aarhus University, 2003.<br><br>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268003000120<br><br>This source argues that the Asian tigers’ rapid growth in GDP is because of controversial economic strategy. Paldam uses various journals conducted by university presses about economic freedom and the growth of the Asian tigers. The essay discusses about how the Asian tiger countries came to be and how their growth in GDP differs from other countries. This source can give reason to why the Asian tiger economies are at the same GDP level as the world’s happiest countries, but their happiness is still different. Since their GDP grew in an unusual way this could be evidence to why high GDP does not always equal high happiness.&nbsp;<br></p>
